// Describe the code to improve it

I would not use local storage to store all this information. 
If we need to use the local storage. 
I would create a separate function for that instead of first setting to local storage and then setting the components state. 
useAuthProvide is not returing anything, I would return the user state from this hook. 
I would remove console.logs.Error messages are not very descriptive.
